### <h1 align="center">📌 University Management System</h1>

## 📖 Project Overview  
The University Management System is a C++-based console application that efficiently manages students, professors, and courses using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
It enables users to add, remove, search, and display academic records while ensuring optimized memory management and quick retrieval operations.  
Additionally, Singly Linked Lists and Stacks are implemented to handle dynamic memory allocation, undo operations, and efficient data traversal.

## 🔥 DSA Functionality  

✔ **Singly Linked List** for **storing and managing** student, professor, and course data.  
✔ **Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)** for **undo operations** (restoring deleted objects).  
✔ **Optimized Searching & Traversal Algorithms** for **fast retrieval** of data.  
✔ **Insertion & Deletion Algorithms** with **O(1) time complexity** for efficient operations.  
✔ **Memory-Efficient Storage** using **pointers and dynamic memory allocation.**  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Manage Students, Professors, and Courses** (Add, Remove, Search, Display)  
✅ **Efficient Course Enrollment Management**  
✅ **Implements OOP Principles** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)  
✅ **Association & Aggregation in Object Relationships**  
✅ **User-Friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
✅ **Data Structure Implementations: Singly Linked List & Stack**

## 🏗️ Data Structures Used  

### 🔹 **Singly Linked List**  
- **Students, Professors, and Courses** are stored in separate **linked lists** using pointers (`next1`, `next2`, `next3`).  
- New objects are **inserted at the head** of their respective linked lists.  

### 🔹 **Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)**  
- Used for **undo operations** (removal & restoration of students and professors).  
- The **top pointer** is used to manage stack operations.

## ⏳ Time Complexity & Algorithms  

### 🔍 **Key Algorithms Used:**  

#### **1️⃣ Insertion Algorithm (Linked List)**  
- **Inserts a new node** at the head of the linked list.  
- **Time Complexity:** **O(1)**  

#### **2️⃣ Traversal Algorithm (Linked List)**  
- **Iterates through nodes** to search and display objects.  
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**  

#### **3️⃣ Stack Operations**  
- **Push (store deleted object):** `push_std(Student*)` and `push_pro(Professor*)`  
  - Inserts node at the **top** of the stack.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(1)**  
- **Pop (restore object):** `pop_std()` and `pop_pro()`  
  - Removes node from the **top** of the stack.  
  - **Time Complexity:** **O(1)**
